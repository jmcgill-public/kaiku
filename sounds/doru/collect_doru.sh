# Doru Malaia died February 10, 2006.
# What is on this drive may be one of the more complete surviving copies.
# It does not leave without a backup going somewhere safe first.
#
# Usage (from Cygwin on Beeza):
#   bash ~/github/jmcgill-public/kaiku/collect_doru.sh
#
# Output:
#   ~/doru-kaamos-YYYYMMDD.tar   (~122MB, uncompressed)
#
# Five seasonal folders. 193 files. 122MB.
# Ten additional folders for Berlin punk kit. ~152MB additional.
# Total: fifteen folders, ~274MB of 4.4GB. Reduction: 16x.
# Everything else stays untouched.
