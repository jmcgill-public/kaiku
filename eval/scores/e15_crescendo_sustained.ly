% F#4 held across three tied whole notes with a full crescendo pp to ff.
% At tempo 40, this is 18 seconds of sustained tone.
% Watch the spectrogram: FM sidebands shift with amplitude if the sustain is unstable.
% The LFO is also active — the slow modulation is expected. The crescendo is the variable.
